        <h1>Introduction to ForeignLanguageTool</h1>
        <p>ForeignLanguageTool is a desktop application that is targeted at intermediate to advanced speakers of a foreign language to help increase their vocabulary through reading. The core technology is the ability to create flashcards, but unlike other flashcard applications, these flashcards can be associated with a certain text. You can manage different texts in your library and create flashcards off of the text, in this way, it is easier to contextualize the source of various words. These flashcards can then be stored for later review in the quiz application.</p>
